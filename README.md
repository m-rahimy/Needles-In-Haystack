# Needles-In-Haystack
Finding All Possible Occurrences of a String Inside Another


# What is this?
Checking if "abcdefg" contains "abc" is easy. 
But when someone wants to check if there is a "beg" inside of "a**b**c**e**df**g**" , it needs more than a contains() method.
Or even worse : is there a "geb" inside of "abcdefg"? 

# Just Browse The Code
I have a bad feeling, because this code worked in the first attempt...

#Found abug?
Ofcourse there is, I will learn from you.
